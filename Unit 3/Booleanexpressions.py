# Boolean expression
# kind of like a math formula
# 14 + 10 = 24      #arithmatic opperators
# can only evaluate to true or false
# 5 > 10 = False        #Boolean uses comparison operators
# > < >= <= == !=

print(14 + 10)  #Arithmatic
print(5 > 10)   #Comparison
print(5 == 5)   #== askes "are you equal?"
x = 5           #seting x = to 5, tell it what to be
print(x == 5)   #get x = 5, ask question

# this is the perfect test question 
#what is the difference between = and ==?

print(4 >= 2)           #True
print(1993 == 1993)     #True
print(-90 < -99)        #False
print(10 != 10)         #False,   != is not equal to
